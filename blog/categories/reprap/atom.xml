    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife recently said that I have a criminal record.  Of course, she didn&rsquo;t mean a <em>real</em> criminal record (I think)&hellip;</p>

<p>What we were talking about was my tendency of occasionally spending relatively large sums of money on rather frivolous purchases.  E.g., an expensive camera that doesn&rsquo;t get used much, or this:</p>

<p>I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakerBot_Industries#Cupcake_CNC">Makerbot Cupcake</a> in April 2010.  I played around with it a bit, but got a bit disheartened with the fiddliness and what I felt was a lack of precision in the prints.  For the last 3 years it&rsquo;s been languishing in a cupboard.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been maybe feeling a little guilty about my poor Cupcake.  A little more pertinently, I&rsquo;ve also been looking at videos of newer <a href="http://reprap.org">RepRap</a> models and fancy building one from scratch.  So in the hope of building some of the plastic parts for a shiny new <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Mendel">Mendel</a> or perhaps a  <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Huxley">Huxley</a>, I&rsquo;ve dug out the old one and fired it up.  All the components seem to still work, but I haven&rsquo;t printed anything with it yet.  Hopefully tonight&hellip;</p>
