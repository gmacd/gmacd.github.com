Happy New Year!

Also, if you want to query which machine-dependent flags are set in gcc, run this line:

`gcc -Q --help=target`

This will spit out which machine-dependent settings would be enabled or disabled if gcc is run with no additional configuration.  Specify more settings to analyze further:

`gcc -Q --help=target -m64 -msse2`

...which tells us that both -msse and -msse2 are set.

Finally, executing this:

`gcc -Q --help=target -march=native`


...tells me which machine-dependent settings can be used on the machine on which the command was executed.

All this is useful when working on SSE code.
