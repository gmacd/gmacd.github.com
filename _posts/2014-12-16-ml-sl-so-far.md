(Ooh, the draft for this post was created exactly 1 month ago (+ 15 minutes).  Must try harder.)

I've been studying the [Machine Learning: Supervised Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud675) course on Udacity for a few days now.

So far I've completed the first 3 of 10 parts of this course.  The completed parts are:

1. Decision Trees
2. Regression & Classification
3. Neural Networks

One of the hardest things I've found is to avoid the temptation of coding.  I want to play with Clojure and Go and make websites and games and generally tinker.  That's not really conducive to studying.  Luckily, I have only one more part to complete (4. Instance Based Learning) before Problem Set 1, which I'm hoping involves coding up some of the algorithms.
