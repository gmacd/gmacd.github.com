I'm going to make a game.

I've said it before, and I'll probably say it again, but this time's for real.

(Also, I've just deleted a few recent, irrelevant posts about building a larger MOOC out of multiple smaller free online courses, with a financial bent.  That's fallen by the wayside a bit (completely), I'll admit, but it's a bit out of context of the rest of this blog, so it's gone.)

So what to use?  I've tried Unity, and got a bit frustrated.  I've tried writing in Go, then in C, and got further in Go.  Now I'm looking at C++, on top of bgfx, after reconsidering Unity 5.  Hopefully this will stick, because I'd like to make something resembling a game rather than a test.
