Looks like it's been 4 months since my last update, so here's another.

I've got 4 days left of my contract, having spent 2 years working on a commodity derivatives trading system.  Nearly all .Net, lots of SQL.  Now that that's done, I'm taking a couple of months off to relax and work on my own project.

Not much to say about the project yet, other than it's an interactive webapp, currently being written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).

Maybe it'll come to nothing, but it'll be a nice change and a chance to play with some different technologies.

Anyway, I wouldn't want to give too much away yet, but I'm excited at least :)
