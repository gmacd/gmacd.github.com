I need to build a curriculum.  I'm not entirely sure what my course is called yet, but it (currently) has a focus on AI and robotics.

I wanted to get started quickly, but as I mentioned in my [previous post](/mooc/2014/11/15/showwhatyouknow.html), there aren't many interesting courses starting now, or have started in the last week, so I'm restricted in what I can choose.

Another important point is ensuring I don't commit to too many overlapping courses - I really don't have time to do more than one course simultaneously for long.

Finally, I want to spend a bit of time experimenting with [BEAM robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_robotics) at some point.  I haven't found any courses that cover this, beyond electronics, so I'll have to do that myself.

Curriculum
----------

So far I've started:
* [Machine Learning: Supervised Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud675) (Udacity, any time, 8 weeks)

Here are some upcoming courses:
* [Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud741) (Udacity, any time, 4 weeks)
* [Machine Learning: Reinforcement Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud820) (Udacity, any time, 4 weeks)
* [Light, Spike, and Sight: The Neuroscience of Vision](https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-9-01-1x-light-spike-sight-3196) (edX, 18th November 2014, 9 weeks)

I'll post more updates as the curriculum grows.
