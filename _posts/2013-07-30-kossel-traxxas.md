I've decided to build a Kossel Mini delta 3D printer.  This is the first part that's been delivered.  It'll be a long time before I'll complete this, but I've ordered some of the parts, and I plan on keeping a build log here.

You can see more about the [Mini Kossel here](http://deltabot.tumblr.com).
