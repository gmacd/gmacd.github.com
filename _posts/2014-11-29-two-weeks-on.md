So it's been about 2 weeks since my last post, and things have been pretty quiet.  I've had a bad cold for the last week and a half, and have been away for a family wedding.  This left me without the motivation or time to do much after work recently.

So what have I done?  Well...

* I've begun the [Machine Learning: Supervised Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud675) course, but then stalled a bit due to a cold and wedding.  I'll summarise my thoughts on this in a separate post
* I had a look at [Light, Spike, and Sight: The Neuroscience of Vision](https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-9-01-1x-light-spike-sight-3196).  After watching the first video, I was really put off by the awful intro video.  It seemed to be trying to be far too 'poppy', with terrible, too-loud background dance music.  First impressions count, and this didn't encourage me to spent any more of what little time I have on this course.
* I attended an [excellent talk by Gary Kazantsev of Bloomberg](http://www.meetup.com/London-Machine-Learning-Meetup/events/218615295) for the [London Machine Learning Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/London-Machine-Learning-Meetup).  The talk was an overview of the work of the machine learning R&D group at Bloomberg.  There was talk of sentiment analysis and market impact prediction amongst other topics.  One interesting requirement for their work tends to be the need for predictions as quickly as possible, typically in less than a second.
