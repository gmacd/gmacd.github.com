One of the main advantages of a DIY course of study (there must be a better name for this...) is that it's more flexible.  Working full time, being a parent to two kids and then having a cold on top of that doesn't leave much time to study.  Well, there is time, but it's not 'good' time.  It's time during which you're run down and is time better spent resting.

That's fine if you're not tied to deadlines.

On the other hand, not being tied to deadlines takes away a useful motivational tool.  It's a little harder to keep up the momentum.

I feel myself recovering now.  The wedding's over, I'm back home, and it feels like I'm on the tail end of this cold.  [Gotta keep moving.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2KgiFh15FM)
