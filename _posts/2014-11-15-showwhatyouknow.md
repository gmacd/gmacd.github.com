Having looked at what's on offer on Coursera (mainly), but also on Udacity, edX and FutureLearn, it seems that a lot of the courses I was interested in follow academic terms.  That means that finding a course starting around mid-November is tough.  I don't want to begin a course where I've missed deadlines before I've watched my first video, and I don't want to wait a month.

Luckily, there are some interesting course on Udacity which allow you to start whenever you want, and follow at your own pace (very useful when you have a full time job and two kids to entertain!).  You lose the pressure of deadlines, but you gain flexibility.

Another difference seems to be that Udacity only offers you certificates if you pay for the course, whereas Coursera will offer you one for free.

To be honest, certificates have an appeal, a bit like trophies/achievements in games, but they're probably not worth the paper they're (not) written on.  If I was interviewing someone for a job and they put down a list of online courses they've completed (with certificate links perhaps), I'd probably not pay too much attention to it, other than note the fact that they're willing to educate themselves (an important trait in all good developers).  What would be more impressive is if someone can point to evidence they understand what they claim to have achieved, perhaps through blogging, or some projects.

So with this in mind, I intend to be as open as possible about what I'm learning, both through this blog and some demos.
