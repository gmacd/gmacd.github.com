I'm currently listening to the Chemical Brothers Glastonbury set.  I went to see them several years ago with my now-wife, at Brixton Academy.  They were great then, and they're great now.

Also, I've learned that saying something on a blog like 'I'm going to make a game' is a daft idea, when you haven't started yet, you're over-ambitious and you don't have enough time.  It's a lose-lose situation.  I've spent too much time making games I haven't a hope of progressing far with in my spare time.  It's a shame, but realistic.  Boo.  Maybe I'll try again in retirement :)
