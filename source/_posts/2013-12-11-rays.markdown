A few years ago I bought a very nice book on raytracing with the intention of implementing my own.  I’d previously followed part way through [this series of tutorials on flipcode](http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Raytracing_Topics_Techniques-Part_1_Introduction.shtml), and wanted to delve further.

As might be seen from the pristine condition of my book, I didn’t get very far.

Recently I thought I’d give it another go, but this time in [Go](http://golang.org).  First step would be to get a very basic ray tracer up and running before working through the books, so back to the tutorial.

Here are the results of my efforts - the same image generated from the first article in the tutorial.

You can find the code [on Github here](https://github.com/gmacd/rays).  I plan on at least following through the first three articles before moving onto the book, so I’ll post more shots and details here when they’re ready.
