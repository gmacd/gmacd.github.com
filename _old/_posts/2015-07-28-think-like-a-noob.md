When I write code, I tend to obsess over small details, wanting to get them just right.  This can be a good thing, leading to nice, neat code, but it can also be a hinderance, leading to time being wasted for small wins.

This is especially a problem when I'm working on personal projects, where my time is limited.  There's more chance of me getting distracted by some other interesting project if the my current one is going slowly.

Perhaps what I need to do is instead to thing like a Noob.  Instead of worrying about crafting it to be perfect, just get it working and move on.  This will lead to scrappier code, but hopefully more visible progress.  Who knows, I may even complete one of these personal projects....

(probably not though)
