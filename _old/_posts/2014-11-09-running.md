I need to run more.

I seem to be a periodic runner.  I run in bursts - a few months at a time, pretty regularly, then nothing for a few more months.  Once I begin again, I'm having to get back into shape again.

It's a bit frustrating, especially as I want to beat my not particularly impressive marathon best (and only) of 4'47.  Not that I have the time for long training runs, a good 10K time would be a better objective, but some day...

Anyway, the main reason I'm going for a run tomorrow is that the lack of exercise has been affecting my mood.  My wife thinks I'm a little less positive than usual, and suspects it's due to a lack of running.  Despite being more tired when running regularly, I'm a bit more positive.  Must be those endorphins, that runner's high.

Looks like it might be dryish tomorrow too, so a lap around Regent's Park, or a run up Primrose Hill at lunchtime tomorrow should be a nice break in the day.

Here's to being positively knackered.
