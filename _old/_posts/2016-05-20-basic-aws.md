So now I'm a trendy web dev, I thought I'd put my prototype up on AWS.  Currently, I've only written client-side code, so I've uploaded the single, minified html file to S3.  Once uploaded, it's easy to verify it's accessible via the link provided by Amazon.

For my next trick, I'm tyring to set up a CNAME record to link from my website to the S3-hosted app.  Pending...  The anticipation is killing me!
