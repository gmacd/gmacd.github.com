[Procdump](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900) can be used to get a crash dump for an process in varying circumstances.

In my (test) case, my app is throwing NotImplementedException, and I want to create a crash dump when that is raised and not handled.  Once the process is running, and before the exception is raised, I hook procdump to my process using the following command:

`procdump -e -ma myapp.exe`

Note that myapp.exe is the name of the process - not the filepath.
