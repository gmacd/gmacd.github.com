My wife recently said that I have a criminal record.  Of course, she didn't mean a *real* criminal record (I think)...

What we were talking about was my tendency of occasionally spending relatively large sums of money on rather frivolous purchases.  E.g., an expensive camera that doesn't get used much, or this:

I bought a [Makerbot Cupcake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakerBot_Industries#Cupcake_CNC) in April 2010.  I played around with it a bit, but got a bit disheartened with the fiddliness and what I felt was a lack of precision in the prints.  For the last 3 years it's been languishing in a cupboard.

Recently I've been maybe feeling a little guilty about my poor Cupcake.  A little more pertinently, I've also been looking at videos of newer [RepRap](http://reprap.org) models and fancy building one from scratch.  So in the hope of building some of the plastic parts for a shiny new [Mendel](http://reprap.org/wiki/Mendel) or perhaps a  [Huxley](http://reprap.org/wiki/Huxley), I've dug out the old one and fired it up.  All the components seem to still work, but I haven't printed anything with it yet.  Hopefully tonight...
