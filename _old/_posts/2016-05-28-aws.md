Continuing the project journal, I'm now on my second day of mid-life-crisis/temp-retirement/holiday.  The first day was mostly spent feeling hungover after a few leaving drinks.

Today was mostly dealing with kids, but I have been setting up a Makefile to build my Elm app, and deploy it on s3 via the AWS command line tools.  So far so good.  Makefiles are always a bit fiddly, but I've created something functional.  It'll rebuild on changes to my .elm files, although changes to the html or css files require a rebuild.  I'll fix that some other time.

I'm using the AWS command line tools from my Makefile.  So far, the command line help seems very good.  `aws s3 sync target s3://mybucket` seems to be the way to go (once the permissions are sorted out).
